Simple Syntax highlighter for LambdaMOO MOOCODE

## Features

Syntax highlighting for MOOCode (as used by LambdaMOO)

A MOO (MUD, object-oriented) is a text-based online virtual reality system to which multiple users (players) are connected at the same time.

(MUD = Multi User Dungeon)

MOOCode is the coding language used internall on MOOs.

This should work for most varieties of MOO, but is particulaly geared towards the LambdaMoo+stunt forks, which have support for the map type.

Colours have been picked more or less at random based on what was supported by the default Dark theme in Visual Studio Code, but should work OK with most themes.
